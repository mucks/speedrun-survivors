### Inspiration
- Vampire Survivors
- Worms


### Player Character
- Pepe
- Bonk Inu
- Pudgy Penguin
- Crypto Kitties
- Mad Lads
- will add different NFT hero characters over time
  - each with different base stats
  - theoretical collaboration with any existing NFT collection


### Character stats
- Health
- Health regen
- Movement speed
- weapon cooldown +/- x %


### Weapons
- possible Manual Aim (Primary; ACTIVE)
    - CONSIDER THIS: manual aim -> complex REPLAY check
        - fire on click -> with rotation in 256 increments (u8)
        - this whole game is about attack spamming
            - not realistic to constantly update rotation
        -  manual aim main attack must be slow (cooldown) and insanely powerful (fun) if added
    - BEAM rifle
    - RPG
- Passive Attacks
    - Grenade launcher
        - Napalm AoE
        - Explosive AoE
    - Nova attacks
        - Electric shock
        - Fire
    - Flame Thrower
    - Drones
        - Man-Hack (Half Life 2)
        - Shooting
    - Laser beams


### Passive Buffs / DeBuffs
- Invincibility on DMG received
- More XP gained
- More Gold gained
- AoE boost
- DMG boost
- Cooldown boost
- Health boost
- Health regen boost
- Movement speed boost
- Magnet for gold / item Pickup
- Debuffs allow players to get higher scores if they survive it
  - faster enemy spawn
  - greater quantity of enemies spawned


### Undead system
- hero gains
  - 100% attack speed
  - 100% move speed
- start a timer of 10 - 30 sec
- will explode in huge blast if time runs out
- has to either
    - find a shrine of resurrection in due time
    - defeat some Death boss enemy and drain/possess their soul or whatever for a resurrection
    - this could possibly influence the look of their NFT
        - becomes more death-ish (ghoul like) looking over time? (how to do that; need upgradeable NFTs)


### Tech thoughts


#### Replays
- generate some u256 random number to derive (seed) all "randomness" from
- this is the replay GUID
- to prevent replay attacks, each GUID should be globally unique forever
- all user input is logged.
- Server replays should arrive at the same outcome
    - award NFTs and Tokens
    - requires single threaded RNG access I suppose
- Protocol thoughts
    - 1 byte action OP code
    - 3 byte tick (= 60 tickrate)
        - 3 bytes allow for 4660 minutes = 77 hours
    - = 4 byte per WASD action (@5APS -> 9000 actions -> 36000 byte -> ~35 KB)
    - Could compress by using several OPCODEs
        - W_ON_2 +2 byte
        - W_ON_3 +3 byte
        - A_ON_2 +2 byte
        - A_ON_3 +3 byte
        - ... S, D (_ON_ and _OFF_)(=16 OpCodes)
        - FIRE +1 byte (rotation 256 degrees then -> 1.4Â° increments)


### Bugs
- LDTK
  - maps does not appear in wasm+chrome

### TODO
- XP system
  - could be similar to coin_reward (or even use that)
  - should we have enemy drop XP crystals as in Vamp Survivor?
- Level up system
- Gameplay Effect System
  - need some gameplay data
  - items should have Gameplay Effect stacks
  - need to gather this data and attach it to the player
- UI
  - TIME ELAPSED
  - LEVEL PROGRESS
- REPLAY / recording system
    - playback system
    - headless server playback
- VFX
    - https://bevyengine.org/examples/2D%20Rendering/bloom-2d/


### NFTs
What would be a resale value? What would make them tradeable?

- Cool looks
- heros are NFTs with various base stats
    - i.e. Pepe is fast but weak, ...
    - must not be required to play (can always play mint NFT after then game to "save state")
        - always a free mint of base hero
- NFTs as powerups; equipped inventory style at the start of a game
- NFTs as weapons; equipped inventory style at the start of a game


How to not flood the market and make them worthless?

- Derived & bind to ladder mode / season / cohort
- lost on death?
- maybe some "craft" logic that lets users combine / upgrade their NFTs but there is some chance it fails and all NFTs get deleted?
    - Lineage enchanting style


### Token
Launch without a token but keep track of player scores (in-game gold) - do an airdrop to players and or twitter followers or galxe quest etc.

This token could then be used to:
- buy NFTs, upgrades etc.
- unlock new maps, game modes, ...
- join ranked ladders ("pro play")
